# What is this?

This is a personal space I decided to make so that I could have an online portfolio, and also upload all of my essays and writings to an environment
that is public, but not that public ðŸ˜….

I really enjoy writing, whether it is an essay about a movie I like, my thoughts on a certain topic, or just
a reflection about any kind of situation that may have occured to me. Throughout the years many of my
friends and teachers told me that I should post them somewhere, so I decided that the best place to do so
would be my own site, which could also serve as a way of announcing new projects I might be working on, and also just
provide a showcase of some of the projects I have been able to work on throughout the years...
